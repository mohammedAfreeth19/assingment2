** Write a blog difference between document and Window object ?
    
    
 Introduction

      When working with web development or browser automation, understanding the difference between the Document and Window objects is crucial.
     These terms refer to specific components within a web browser that handle different aspects of web pages.

Document and Window Objects: 

1. Document Object:
                       A Document object represents the web page's content. It's an instance of the Document Object Model (DOM),
    which is a tree-like structure that represents the structure of a web page.Each element on a web page, such as text, images, and links,
    is represented as a node in the DOM tree. Developers interact with the Document object to manipulate the content of a web page dynamically.

 2. Window Object:
              A Window object represents the browser window. It includes everything that the user can see and interact with, such as the browser's user interface 
      elements like the address bar, navigation buttons, and tabs. Each open tab or window in a browser is a   separate Window object. Developers can interact 
     with the Window object to control the behavior of the browser, such as opening new tabs, resizing the window, or accessing browser history.


Scope:
      Document Object: Represents the content of a web page. It includes HTML elements, text, images, and other nodes that make up the structure and content of the page.
      Window Object: Represents the entire browser window. It includes the DOM, as well as browser-specific features like the address bar, navigation buttons, and tabs.

Hierarchy:
      Document Object: The document object is a property of the window object. It is accessible via window.document or simply document.
      Window Object: The window object is the top-level object in the browser environment. 
             It contains properties and methods that control the browser's behavior and manage its state.

Usage:
       Document Object: Developers primarily interact with the document object to manipulate the content of a web page dynamically. 
       This includes tasks like adding or removing elements, changing text, or updating styles.
       Window Object: Developers interact with the window object to control the browser's behavior, such as opening new tabs, resizing the window, or accessing browser history.

Events:
        Document Object: Events that occur within the document, such as clicks, keypresses, or page loads, are handled using event listeners attached to the document object.
       Window Object: Events that occur at the window level, such as resizing the window or closing a tab, are handled using event listeners attached to the window object.

Accessibility:
       Object: The document object is accessible from within the window object, allowing developers to interact with the content of a web page.
      Window Object: The window object is accessible from within the document object, enabling developers to control the behavior of the browser.


  Why Document and Window Objects Matter to Developers

  Understanding the distinction between Document and Window objects is essential for web developers for several reasons:

1. Manipulating Content: Developers need to know how to manipulate the content of a web page using the Document object to create dynamic and interactive user experiences.

2. Browser Control: Developers can use the Window object to control the behavior of the browser, such as opening new tabs or windows, navigating to different URLs, or resizing the window.

3. Event Handling: Events in web browsers, such as clicks, keypresses, or page loads, are handled differently depending on whether they occur within the Document or Window context.

4. Cross-Origin Restrictions: Browser security policies, such as the same-origin policy, restrict access to resources across different origins (domains). 
   Developers need to understand how these policies affect their ability to access and manipulate Document and Window objects.
